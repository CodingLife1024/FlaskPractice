# COP290 Lab 3
Building a website project for cop 290 under Prof. Abhilash Jindal.

We have created a social media website where users can -

1. create a profile
2. create posts with text and photos
3. follow other users and see their profile and posts
4. search for users or posts
5. like, dislike and comment on pos

Frontend created using html and css
Backend done using Flask and Python
Integrating the frontend and backend is work in progress.

The site sends you to a welcome page which later directs the user to sign up page if you are a new user otherwise the registered user gets directed to the login page. The login page asks for your username and password.

login -> timeline
Navigation bar common to all pages except welcome,login and signup. It includes timeline,popular,search,profile and logout.

posts-> can like,dislike and comment also can go to the post's owner profile
popular -> can see most liked posts
search -> search for posts and users
profile -> can create new posts, see followers , following , own posts
